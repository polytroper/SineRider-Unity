CaptureTheGIF

by Duaelist Studios and Twisted Oak Studios

How to capture gif on key press:
1. find the CaptureOnKey prefab in the CaptureTheGIF/Prefabs/ folder
2. drag it into your scene
3. configure


options:
button name - name of the button to push to take a gif
button type - use either a fixed key, or one from unity's Input manager
dir - the directory to save the gif in. this is relative to Application.dataPath
name - name of the gif file. if it already exists a number will be appended to the end
frames - number of frames to capture
frame rate - how many times per second to capture a frame
height - desired height of the gif
aspect - aspect ratio (width/height)
lock framerate - use fixed timesteps during capture (looks ugly in game, but can give better gif results)
